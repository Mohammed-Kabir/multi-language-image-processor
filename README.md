Multi-language Image Processor
This Streamlit app uses Google Generative AI to analyze images containing text in multiple languages.

It is designed for multilingual document analysis, translation, and intelligent Q&A based on image content.

1. Upload images (JPG, JPEG, PNG) for analysis
2. Automatic description and summary generation in English
3. Translation of text from various languages to English
4. Interactive question box for custom queries about the image
